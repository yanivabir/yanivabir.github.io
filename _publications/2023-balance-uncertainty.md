title: 'Human Exploration Strategically Balances Approaching and Avoiding Uncertainty'
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'How do humans achieve the goal of resolving uncertainty when they explore their environment? We find that rather than always exploring the parts of their environment they are more uncertain about, individuals sometimes avoid learning about uncertain options. They do so when uncertainty is very high for all parts of the environment. We think the strategic balance between approaching and avoiding uncertainty helps humans manage their cognitive resources when faced with complex problems.'
