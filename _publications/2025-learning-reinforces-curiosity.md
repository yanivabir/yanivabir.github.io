excerpt: 'Is curiosity a drive to seek information for its own sake, or an adaptive policy we learn from experience? In this study, we tested these two ideas: one suggests curiosity fades once it’s satisfied, while the other argues that satisfying curiosity can make us even more curious in the future. Across data from over 5,000 people, we found strong evidence for the latter. When people learned something that felt surprisingly satisfying, they became more curious about related topics—and less curious about unrelated ones. These findings suggest that curiosity is not just a built-in urge, but a habit we learn through experience. This helps explain why people often seek far more information than can be justified by practical or economic benefit: we explore not only to make better decisions, but also to learn what kinds of things are worth being curious about.'
